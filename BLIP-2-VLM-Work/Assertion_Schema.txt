Human Question: Is a chair actually present in the image?    False -> Hacllucination, Missing expected entity -> Omission

Human Question: Is the shelf actually on the left relative to the user?      Wrong relation -> Spatial Hallucination, Missing spatial -> Spatial Omission

Human Question: Is this safety risk real and correctly identified?      False safety claim -> Safety Hallucination, Missed hazard -> Critical Safety Omission
If a real hazard exists but is not asserted: Critical Omission
